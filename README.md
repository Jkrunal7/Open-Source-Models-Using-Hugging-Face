# Open Source Models Using Hugging Face

This project explores various open-source models available on Hugging Face and demonstrates their application across diverse AI tasks. From audio and image analysis to text processing, the project showcases how these models can be accessed either via endpoint APIs or by directly downloading and running them locally.

**Key Features:**

- **Audio and Image Classification:** Implements models to classify audio signals and images into predefined categories.
- **Image Captioning:** Generates descriptive captions for images using state-of-the-art image-to-text models.
- **Image Retrieval:** Enables retrieving similar images based on input queries or visual features.
- **Object Detection:** Identifies and labels objects within an image using advanced detection models.
- **Sentence Embedding:** Converts text into dense vector representations for downstream tasks like similarity search.
- **Text Summarization:** Summarizes lengthy text into concise and coherent summaries.

**Access Methods:**

- **Endpoint API:** Accesses Hugging Face models via API endpoints for quick and efficient usage.
- **Local Deployment:** Downloads and runs models locally for greater flexibility and control.
